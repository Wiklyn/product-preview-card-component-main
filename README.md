## Overview

A challenge that needs some responsivity. The designs, inside the design foulder, must be followed according to the size of the screen. One is meant to screens with width of 375px and the other one to screens with width of 1440px. Besides that there is a hover effect on the button on the larger size of screen.

## My process

I started writing the HTML5 of the page so then I could go to the CSS3 part and pu the styles required. The first design I replicated was the mobile design and then I moved on to the desktop design using the media querry technique.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make a picture change on the HTML5 using the tag <picture>.
